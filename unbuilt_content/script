player eventually finds edges, all roads lead north

effect is achieved by having tiles all white and background a pulsing purple effect, as in current main menu

XAB) the player can also go left or right which will take them to two NPCs, who represnet a yin and yang dynamic

talking to both will create an electrical field which attaches to the player. when both electrical fields, which should be animated as arcs, the man who is a doorway will allow entry into the picture frame.

-- as the player traverses between XAA and XAB the background will crossfade from the original pulsating purple circuits, to a peachy "dusk on the prarie" sunset

C003 Act I.
        Beginning at the ROM Cafe

FOREST BACKGROUND
CHURCH TILES

Player must navigate an entry way with spikes to the west

Vignetting effect used to distinguish between INT and EXT 

to the north is a wall, with laterns, and vents. underneath this, is the bartender(Irith) a spooky figure reminiscent of the doorway man

there are two characters to the south. One is a raven like creature(Zorus). The other is a smoking, skeleton like figure in a ragged trench coat (Carnus). 

to the east is a corridor with green living plants. By contrast, the rest of the world looks dead and skeletal. The room has an eerie turqouise glow. 

A dilapidated computer terminal is here, encorached on by vines. It has an amber screen. The player may learn the lore of the CONTROL PROCESS MODULE,
a story of engineers and businessmen - ending with one of the engineers digitizing himself and starting the ROM Cafe, a sort of incubation zone
for new binaries to come to term with their existence. What is described is more lush than where the player finds themselves.

The player may talk to Zorus:

    Oh, neat...
    ...fresh meat!

The player may talk to Carnus:

    VECTORLORD, is that what you are?
    ...I see.
    Do you know where you are?
    We're underneath the discs. 
    There are more places like this.
    We'll see if you get that far!

To which Zorus responds:

    SQUAK!
    Don't stay here too long. 

The player may talk to Irif:

    ...
    a new binary?
    times are dark indeed...
    system complexity is increasing...
    I can't remember the last time we had a 
    LORD series through here. 
    I wish you luck, I suppose.
    Have a potion. (player receives 1x health potion)
     
(Subtext: VECTORLORD is not completely binary, and has some humanity,)
