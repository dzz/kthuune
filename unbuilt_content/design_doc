[ THE PLOT ]
=============

You are one of the last VECTORLORDs infused with a KTHUNIAN TELEKINE, 

The BELLBIRD is dying and is losing its ability to hold back the BAKAZOURIA who are invading KTHUNIA, and consuming the flesh of the KTHUNIANS.

As the KTHUNIAN HIVEMIND writhes in its last moment, you, the VECTORLORD has been resurrected to fight the
GALAMESH and the CORRUPTED KTHUUNES

[ THE CREATURES ]
=================

VECTORLORDS are non KTHUNIAN, may also be slaves like the BELLBIRD. They protect KTHUNIA when summoned by chaotic ruptures to the KTHUNIAN HIVEMIND.

The ELDERs are echoes of KTHUUNEs 

The  BELLBIRD is a cosmic beast, enslaved by the KTHUNIANS to hold shut the PHASE VORTEX. Its death is visualized like a bacteria being attacked by bacteriophages. 

The BAKAZORA are an all consuming demonic force arising from decayed quantum states in neighboring universes

A TELEKINE is a juvenile KTHUNIAN 

A CORRUPTED KTHUNIAN has had its genetic code rewritten by the phase shift, though white and red faced like regular kthunes, their visages and bodies show BAKAZOURIAN features.

The BAKAZOURIAN are a dark force which manifests physically in the forms of wraiths, zombies, spiders, witches. In other dimensions they may be merely dark matter, but when passing through a PHASE VORTEX they manifest as a corrupting physical presence been on destruction and consumption.

[ THE SETTING ]
===============

KTHUNIANs live on a foggy, wet planet. They use a mix of technologies familiar to the human dimension and fantastical. Space ships, Radio towers, etc.  Their world is a mix of fantasy and technology

VECTORLORDs orbit in CHEMEOSTASIS tanks, but they have a ship which is capable of travelling the Kthunian solar system. They are a last effort 'insurance policy' against the BAKAZOURIAN.

[ THE PLAYER EXPERIENCE ]
=========================

The player attacks with a magic sword, and its TELEKINE. The sword is a nanosword which can be upgraded through research.

Research is done on the player's ship, THE HAUNTED PILGRIM.

Research is paid for by collecting NEON(Ne), THORIUM (Th), CARBON (C), which may be dropped by enemies, or mined by attacking CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES in the OORT CLOUD.

The TELEKINE is held in a vat on THE HAUNTED PILGRIM. It can be upgraded and works something like a Tamigotchi, showing side effects of the upgrades (generally growing more grotesque) while in the vat. Upgrading the TELEKINE requires PROKARYOTES, and EUKARYOTES. These will be dropped by CORRUPTED KTHUNIANs.

Oozing black hole, surrounded by worms. Dark.
