VECTORLORD
==========

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ THE STORY SO FAR ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the planet of GAIA, The council of Kthuunian WIZARD PROTECTORS becomes aware that VORLENT THE BLACK has betrayed them and opened a portal to the CTHONIAN DIMENSION.

A CTHONIAN DREADNAUGHT warps through the portal and CTHONIAN GHOULS descend on the capital city, brutally murdering its inhabitants. Only the most resiliant remain, driven to the underground. Some outlaws, some freedom fighters. They fight a losing battle. 

In a last ditch effort, the WIZARD PROTECTORS resurrect PROJECT VECTORLORD: A supersoldier, built from the DNA of the ELDER KING, infused with the power of the ANCIENT TELEKINES.

You are VECTORLORD, you are GAIA's last hope.

The game proceeds as a series of linear levels, focused on left to right progression.

In between each sequence, the VECTORLORD returns to THE XEOLIEX, where they can spend points to upgrade sword and telekine powers, and choose loadout. After upgrading, VECTORLORD enters the rehabilitation chamber, which transports them to the kiln for spooky backstory effects.
